# Conversational AI Agentü§ñ
---
This project demonstrates the implementation of a conversational AI agent using OpenAI's powerful language model, along with Langchain for additional functionalities. The AI agent is capable of engaging in conversations on various topics, answering questions, providing recommendations, and more. Additionally, it can be extended to incorporate image recognition capabilities.

## Features üåü

- **Contextual Responses**: Generates contextually relevant responses based on conversation history.
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Retrieves information from external sources or databases to answer queries.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Supports multi-turn conversations with context retention.
- **Image Recognition**: Capable of recognizing and analyzing images to provide relevant responses.

### Prerequisites

- Python (v3.6 or newer)
- OpenAI API Key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to get your API key)
- Langchain (installation instructions provided below)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd conversational-ai-agent
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up Langchain:
   Follow the installation instructions for Langchain from its [official repository](https://github.com/Langchain/langchain).

5. Add your OpenAI API Key:
   Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Usage

Run the main script to start the conversational AI agent:

```sh
python main.py
```

Interact with the AI agent by typing your queries in the terminal.
